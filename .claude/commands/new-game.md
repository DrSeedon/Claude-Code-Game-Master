# /new-game - Create Your World

Create a complete D&D campaign world from scratch through a guided interview.

---

## PHASE 1: CAMPAIGN NAME

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  CREATE YOUR WORLD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Let's build a unique campaign world together.

QUESTION 1 of 4: What's your campaign called?

This will be the name of your save folder.
```

Wait for user response. Store as `CAMPAIGN_NAME`.

### Check if Campaign Already Exists
```bash
bash tools/dm-campaign.sh list
```

If a campaign with this name already exists, ask user:
- Switch to existing campaign?
- Choose a different name?
- Delete and recreate? (requires confirmation)

### Create New Campaign
```bash
bash tools/dm-campaign.sh create "<CAMPAIGN_NAME>"
bash tools/dm-campaign.sh switch "<CAMPAIGN_NAME>"
```

---

## PHASE 1.1: GAME MODE

```
================================================================
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║              GAME MODE                                    ║
  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
================================================================

  [1] Classic (recommended)
      Standard D&D rules. Fast start. No extra setup.

  [2] Advanced
      Custom modules, narrator styles, campaign rule templates.
      More setup — more control.

================================================================
  Enter number (or press ENTER for Classic):
================================================================
```

**If Classic** → Write `"advanced_mode": false` to campaign-overview.json, then skip to PHASE 2.

**If Advanced** → Write `"advanced_mode": true` to campaign-overview.json, then run PHASES 1.5–1.8 (below) before continuing to PHASE 2.

---

## PHASE 1.5: MODULE SELECTION (Advanced only)

Run after campaign is created and switched (so modules persist to campaign-overview.json).

### 1. List available modules
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/tools/dm-module.sh list-verbose
```

### 2. Display module menu

```
================================================================
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║              CONFIGURE MODULES                            ║
  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
================================================================

  [1] ✅ <id>  — <description, 5 words max>  ← default
  [2] ❌ <id>  — <description, 5 words max>
  ...

  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  💡 RECOMMENDED FOR THIS CAMPAIGN:
  Based on campaign name and tone, suggest which modules make
  sense. E.g. for survival/STALKER → custom-stats + firearms.
  For classic D&D → inventory only. For open world → world-travel.
  Write 1-2 sentences why each suggested module fits the vibe.
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Type numbers to toggle (e.g. "1 2") or ENTER to keep current.

================================================================
```

### 3. Apply selection
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/tools/dm-module.sh activate <module-name>    # for each enabled
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/tools/dm-module.sh deactivate <module-name>  # for each disabled
```

### 4. Load module rules into context
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/dm-active-modules-rules.sh
```

Rules are now in context — use them for all world-building that follows.

---

## PHASE 1.6: LOAD MODULE CREATION RULES (Advanced only)

Load creation-specific instructions from active modules:

```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/dm-active-modules-creation-rules.sh
```

These rules tell you HOW to handle world-building for each active module:
- **custom-stats**: Which stats to propose, how to configure them
- **world-travel**: How to generate locations with coordinates and encounters
- **inventory-system**: Starting equipment philosophy and item initialization
- **firearms-combat**: Weapon presets and firearms system configuration

**The creation rules augment (not replace) the phases below.**
Follow module-specific instructions when they apply to that phase.

---

## PHASE 1.7: NARRATOR STYLE (Advanced only)

### 1. List available styles
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/dm-narrator.sh list
```

### 2. Get recommendation based on campaign genre
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/dm-narrator.sh recommend "<genre>"
```
Genre hints from campaign name/tone: horror→horror-atmospheric, classic fantasy→epic-heroic, roguelike/comedy→sarcastic-puns, noir/drama→serious-cinematic.

### 3. Display menu

```
================================================================
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║              NARRATOR STYLE                               ║
  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
================================================================

  [1] epic-heroic        — Grand scale, legendary deeds
  [2] horror-atmospheric — Dread through implication, not gore
  [3] sarcastic-puns     — Terry Pratchett at a tavern
  [4] serious-cinematic  — Every scene is a film shot

  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  💡 RECOMMENDED FOR THIS CAMPAIGN:
  Based on campaign name and genre, suggest which style fits.
  Write 1 sentence why it fits the vibe.
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Type a number to select, or ENTER to accept recommendation.
  Type "skip" to use no defined style.

================================================================
```

### 4. Apply selected style
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/dm-narrator.sh apply <style-id>
```

This writes the full narrator style object into `campaign-overview.json` under `narrator_style`.
The DM will load and follow these rules throughout every session.

### 5. If user provides a custom style file
If user points to a `.md` file with their own style:
- Read the file
- Manually extract voice/rules/forbidden into `narrator_style` in campaign-overview.json
- Follow the same structure as built-in styles

---

## PHASE 1.8: CAMPAIGN RULES TEMPLATE (Advanced only)

### 1. Get recommendation based on campaign genre
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/dm-campaign-rules.sh recommend "<genre>"
```
Genre hints: horror/investigation → horror-investigation, survival/stalker/metro/fallout → survival-zone, space/sci-fi/ftl → space-travel, political/intrigue → political-intrigue, civilization/tribe/4x → civilization.

### 2. List available templates
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/dm-campaign-rules.sh list
```

### 3. Display menu

```
================================================================
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
================================================================

  [1] civilization        — Eras, population, tech tree
  [2] survival-zone       — Resources, morale, hazards
  [3] space-travel        — Ships, FTL, crew
  [4] horror-investigation — Sanity, clues, dread
  [5] political-intrigue  — Factions, influence, secrets

  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  💡 RECOMMENDED FOR THIS CAMPAIGN:
  Based on campaign name and genre, suggest which template fits.
  Write 1 sentence why it fits the vibe.
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Type a number to select, or ENTER to accept recommendation.
  Type "skip" to use standard D&D rules (no custom mechanics).

================================================================
```

### 4. Apply selected template
```bash
bash .claude/additional/infrastructure/dm-campaign-rules.sh apply <template-id>
```

This writes template metadata into `campaign-overview.json` under `campaign_rules_template`
and creates `campaign-rules.md` in the campaign folder.
The DM will load and enforce these rules every session via `/dm-continue`.

**If "skip"**: no campaign-rules.md needed. Standard D&D applies.

### 5. If user wants custom rules
If user describes custom mechanics not covered by templates:
- Generate a `campaign-rules.md` manually based on their description
- Follow the same section structure as built-in templates (eras/resources/combat/diplomacy etc.)

## PHASE 5: WORLD GENERATION

Display progress:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  GENERATING YOUR WORLD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Campaign: "<CAMPAIGN_NAME>"
Tone: <TONE> | Magic: <MAGIC_LEVEL> | Setting: <SETTING_TYPE>

Building your world...

  ├─ Creating starting location.... [working]
  ├─ Populating with NPCs.......... [working]
  ├─ Weaving plot threads.......... [working]
  └─ Establishing connections...... [working]
```

### Generate Starting Location

Based on the setting type, create the starting location with full detail:
- 100+ word description with sensory details
- 3+ named NPCs with personalities
- Connections to adjacent areas
- Local secrets and current events

```bash
bash tools/dm-location.sh add "[Starting Location Name]" "center of the settlement"
bash tools/dm-location.sh describe "[Starting Location Name]" "[detailed description]"
```

### Generate Supporting Locations

Create 3-4 connected locations with moderate detail (50-80 words each):
- A place for services/commerce
- A place for authority/knowledge
- A place representing danger or mystery

```bash
bash tools/dm-location.sh add "[Location Name]" "[position relative to start]"
bash tools/dm-location.sh connect "[Start]" "[Location]" "[path description]"
```

### Generate NPCs

Create 6 interconnected NPCs:
1. **Quest Giver A** - Has a problem to solve
2. **Quest Giver B** - Rival with conflicting goals
3. **Service Provider** - Merchant or craftsperson
4. **Information Source** - Knows local secrets
5. **Mysterious Figure** - Hints at larger plots
6. **Local Character** - Adds flavor and humor

```bash
bash tools/dm-npc.sh create "[Name]" "[description]" "[attitude]"
bash tools/dm-npc.sh tag-location "[Name]" "[location]"
```

### Generate Plot Hooks

Create three interconnected storylines as proper quests:

**Local Conflict** (1-3 sessions)
- Affects starting location directly
- Can be partially resolved quickly

**Regional Mystery** (4-8 sessions)
- Spans multiple locations
- Requires investigation

**World Event** (campaign-long)
- Background threat building
- Only hints initially

```bash
bash tools/dm-plot.sh add "[Local conflict name]" --type side --description "[description]" --objectives "[obj1],[obj2]" --npcs "[npc1]" --locations "[loc1]"
bash tools/dm-plot.sh add "[Regional mystery name]" --type mystery --description "[description]" --objectives "[obj1],[obj2]" --npcs "[npc1]" --locations "[loc1],[loc2]"
bash tools/dm-plot.sh add "[World event name]" --type threat --description "[description]" --objectives "[obj1]"
```

### Schedule Consequences

Plant future events:

```bash
bash tools/dm-consequence.sh add "[Hook to draw players in]" "next session"
bash tools/dm-consequence.sh add "[Strange event occurs]" "2 days"
bash tools/dm-consequence.sh add "[Rumor arrives from afar]" "1 week"
```

### Update Status

As each element completes:
```
  ├─ Creating starting location.... done
  ├─ Populating with NPCs.......... done (6 characters)
  ├─ Weaving plot threads.......... done (3 storylines)
  └─ Establishing connections...... done
```
